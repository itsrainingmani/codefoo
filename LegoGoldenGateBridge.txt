Question 2 - 

Some quick measurements - All of these are approximate values to facilitate easier construction

Lego Bricks:
Length - 3 cm
Width - 1.5 cm
Height - 1 cm

Hence the volume of a single lego brick is 4.5 x 10^-6 cubic meters.
This will be very useful later on.

Golden gate bridge dimensions :
Length of suspension span including main span and side spans is - 2000 m
Width of bridge - 25 m
Height of tower - 230 m

Let's start calculating!

First the road of the bridge itself - 
The road is 2000m long and is 25m wide. I estimate the depth of the road to be 1 meter.
The volume of the road is 2000m x 25m x 1m = 50,000 cubic meters.
We divide this by the volume of a single lego brick to get the number of bricks required for the road.

Number of bricks = 50,000 cubic meters / 4.5 x 10^-6 cubic meters = approximately 11 billion bricks!
We double this to 22 billion bricks to account for the metallic structures under the road.

Now we calculate the bricks in the towers - 
We kniw that the height of each tower is 230m. I estimate the width of the pillar to be approximately 20m
based on how it looks compared to the width of the road. 
The width varies from the bottom to the top but it will be easier to consider a fixed width. The length of the cross-
section of the tower looks to be about twice the size of the width = 40m.
The volume of each tower is 20m x 40m x 230m = 184,000 cubic meters. there are 4 towers of similar dimensions. So the
combined volume is 736,000 cubic meters. 

Number of bricks = 736,000 cubic meters / 4.5 x 10^-6 cubic meters. This comes out to a whopping 163.5 billion bricks.

Lastly we consider the horizontal blocks joining the tower pairs.

We know that the width of the block is about 20m (Width of the road from curb to curb. Not the width of the bridge).
The length looks to be about a 4th of the length of the tower. So the length is 10m. The height also looks to be about 20m.
I'm a little unsure about the measurements on this one.

So anyway, let's get calculating!
Volume of individual block - 20m x 10m x 20m = 4000 cubic meters.
There are 8 of these blocks (4 per tower pair). Total volume - 4000 x 8 = 32,000 cubic meters.

Number of bricks = 32,000 cubic meters / 4.5 x 10^-6 cubic meters = 7 billion bricks.

Hence the total number of bricks is 193 billion bricks (with a pretty decent margin of error).

Bonus - 
I really wanted to calculate how much it would cost for this lego brick bridge to be built. So let's get cracking.
According to the official lego web shop, the standard 2x4 brick which we are using costs 30 cents per unit. So to buy
193 billion bricks we would need $57.8 billion. Wow!. The actual Golden Gate bridge cost $27 million which is equivalent
to $1.5 billion today. So our lego bridge is 39 times more expensive. For legos that expensive they'd better be reinforced
with Vibranium. Hope the Avengers never visit San Francisco!
